## How It Works

Everyday moning *ChefBot* collects the list of dishes available
on http://lunch.team and shares with you the most popular ones,
according with the user ratings.

You can share the picture of a dish you got and start a review of it
with the other users.

The reactions on the survey message represents the user ratings and
they are used to prepare the next list of the most popular dishes.
